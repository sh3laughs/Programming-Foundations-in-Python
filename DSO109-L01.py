# Page 17 - [Practice] Hands On

# 1. Within the main.py file, create three variables that are 
    # set to the following questions:
        # What is your name?
        # How old are you?
        # How many months is that?
    # Hint! Make sure to write these as strings.
nameQ = 'What is your name?'
ageQ = 'How old are you?'
monthsQ = 'How many months is that?'
# variables saved

# 2. Next, create three more variables that are set to the 
    # following answers to the above questions:
        # My name is "Billy".
        # 30
        # 360
nameA = 'My name is "Billy".'
ageA = 30
monthsA = 360
# variables saved

# 3. Use the print function to print each of the variables. 
    # The output should looks like below:
        # What is your name?
        # My name is "Billy".
        # How old are you?
        # 30
        # How many months is that?
        # 360
    # Make sure Billy is surrounded by quotes in the output
print(nameQ)
print(nameA)
print(ageQ)
print(ageA)
print(monthsQ)
print(monthsA)
# variables printed

# 4. Next, comment out the appropriate variables and print 
    # functions so the output now looks like below:
        # What is your name?
        # My name is "Billy".
        # How old are you?
        # 30
nameQ = 'What is your name?'
ageQ = 'How old are you?'
# monthsQ = 'How many months is that?'
nameA = 'My name is "Billy".'
ageA = 30
# monthsA = 360
print(nameQ)
print(nameA)
print(ageQ)
print(ageA)
# print(monthsQ)
# print(monthsA)
# output: variables (re)saved and printed out, other than the
    # ones that were commented out

# 5. Finally, create three new variables: my_string, my_integer, 
        # and my_float.
    # Each variable should be set to the appropriate data type 
        # based on the name of the variable name. The actual 
        # values you use is not important. What is important is 
        # that you match up the right type of data with the right 
        # variable.
    # Print out each variable on separate lines.
my_string = 'Two two point two'
my_integer = 2
my_float = 2.2

print(my_string)
print(my_integer)
print(my_float)
